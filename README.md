# Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface(LIRI)
LIRI is a command line node app that allows the user to retrieve data from Spotify, Twitter, and OMDB.

## Purpose
No longer do you have to open your browser or multiple apps to get the raw data from your favorite entertainment and social media sites. LIRI is an example of that. All you need is one terminal window, a couple of action commands and armed with a list of song or movie titles.
