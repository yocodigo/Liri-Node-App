# Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface(LIRI)
LIRI is a command line node app that allows the user to retrieve data from Spotify, Twitter, and OMDB.

## Purpose
No longer do you have to open your browser or multiple apps to get the raw data from your favorite entertainment and social media sites. LIRI is an example of that. All you need is one terminal window, a couple of action commands and armed with a list of song or movie titles.

## How it works
* 
* Comic book character images storyline is pulled from Comic Vine's API.
* Jquery makes the API calls to find the targetted Movie or comic book character data and render's it on the browser's document.
* Information from the most popular Marvel characters throughout stored in Google Docs is processed by KnightLab and rendered as a  
  timeline on the document.
